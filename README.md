# Dumb Budget

Dumb Budget is a simple application designed to get a general overview of your
budget. Instead of having to put in each transaction or connect to your bank,
you simply figure out an average (e.g. Â£10/day on food) and enter a few of
those. From that it will generate a summary of your budget/spending.
